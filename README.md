I am an aspiring Full Stack Developer, especially a "MERN Stack Developer".


As a seasoned Mechanical Engineer embarking on a transformative journey, I am fueled by a passion for innovation and a desire to blend the precision of engineering with the dynamic world of full-stack development. Currently, Iâ€™m learning the exciting realm of web development, my focus is on becoming a proficient MERN stack developer.


With a foundation rooted in mechanical engineering, I have a proven track record as a Workshop Manager at a Maruti Suzuki dealership. In this role, I honed my technical expertise while leading teams and streamlining workshop operations. This experience instilled in me the importance of efficiency, problem-solving, and effective project management.


Also, I contributed to the intricate world of engineering as an AutoCAD Draftsman under a contractor for Indian Oil. Here, attention to detail and precision were paramount, and I cultivated a keen eye for drafting complex designs.


Eager to expand my skill set and embrace the challenges of the digital landscape, I am currently immersing myself in the intricacies of full-stack web development. The MERN stackâ€”MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js â€” captivates me with its versatility and potential to create dynamic, user-centric applications.


By leveraging the skills acquired in diverse roles, I aim to contribute to innovative projects, bringing a unique perspective and a commitment to excellence.


Embracing continuous learning, I am excited about the limitless possibilities that lie ahead in my journey from a mechanical engineer to a versatile and forward-thinking MERN stack developer.
