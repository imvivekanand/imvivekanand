I am a security professional transitioning from Deep Packet Core Engineering (Nokia/Ericsson) to Cybersecurity Operations. Unlike standard analysts, I understand the network stack from the wire up—analyzing SIP, GTP, and TCP/IP flows to detect anomalies that firewalls miss. My background in maintaining critical telecom infrastructure has instilled a "zero-downtime" mindset, crucial for incident response and threat mitigation.

📡 Mission 1: Securing the Voice Layer (IMS Core)

Role: IMS Engineer (NetSec) | Org: Nokia | July 2025 - Present

Operating at the heart of the telecom network, I manage the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) that powers VoLTE and VoNR. My role goes beyond maintenance; it involves deep inspection of signaling traffic to ensure integrity and availability.

Signaling Analysis: Utilizing Wireshark to dissect SIP packets, identifying malformed headers or flooding attempts that indicate Denial of Service (DoS) attacks or toll fraud.

Infrastructure Hardening: Configuring and auditing CSCF (Call Session Control Function) nodes and MGCF (Media Gateway Control Function) to prevent unauthorized access and ensure strictly regulated call flows.

Incident Response: Monitoring live network KPIs to detect service degradation anomalies, rapidly isolating root causes across the IP transport layer.

Protocols Secured: SIP, VoLTE, RTP, Diameter

🛡️ Mission 2: Defending the Data Plane (Packet Core)

Role: Packet Core Engineer | Org: Ericsson | Sept 2024 - June 2025

Managed the Evolved Packet Core (EPC), the critical data pipe for mobile networks. This role provided a masterclass in tunneling protocols and network segmentation.

Tunnel Security: Deep analysis of GTP (GPRS Tunneling Protocol) traffic, ensuring the separation of Control Plane (GTP-C) and User Plane (GTP-U) to prevent lateral movement and tunnel hijacking attacks.

Node Configuration: Configured security parameters on MME (Mobility Management Entity), SGW (Serving Gateway), and PGW (Packet Gateway) to enforce strict user authentication and data routing policies.

Forensic Troubleshooting: Traced complex connectivity issues across the core network, effectively "hunting" for misconfigurations or protocol errors that mimic security breaches.

Protocols Secured: GTP-C/U, TCP/IP, SCTP, DNS

📱 Mission 3: Application Security & Leadership

Role: Co-Founder & Tech Lead | Org: Jeevandayak | Nov 2020 - Aug 2024

Led the technical development of a consumer-facing Android application, focusing on the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and data privacy.

Secure Development: Implemented logic to prevent data leakage and ensured secure handling of User PII (Personally Identifiable Information) within the SQL database.

Vulnerability Remediation: Identified and patched application logic bugs that could lead to service disruption or unauthorized data access.

Access Control: Designed secure authentication flows to verify user identities and manage session integrity.

Tech Stack: Android, Java, SQL, AppSec
